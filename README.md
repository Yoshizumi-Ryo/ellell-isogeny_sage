# SageMath implementation of $(\ell,\ell)$-isogenies on theta coordiantes.

You can count the number of arithmetic operations of calculating $(\ell,\ell)$-isogenies and implement the SIDH attack on B-SIDH.

These algorithms are proposed in a paper: "Efficient theta-based algorithms 
for computing $(\ell, \ell)$-isogenies 
on Kummer surfaces for arbitrary odd $\ell$."

These are writen in [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org).

## 1.Counting the number of arithmetic operations.

You can count the number of arithmetic operations of $(\ell,\ell)$-isogeny algorithms for prime numbers $3\le \ell\le L$. Here, $L$ is an inputed integer s.t. $3\le L\le 200$.

These are four kinds of alrotihms: $\mathtt{CodSq}, \mathtt{CodOne}, \mathtt{EvalSq}, \mathtt{EvalOne}$. If the  number of arithmetic operations is $m$ multiplications and $s$ã€€squares over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, the result outputs an integer $3m+2s$.
 

Write the following command:

```
sage main.sage "count" {the above L}
```

For example, if $L=20$, 

```
$ sage main.sage "count" 20
Please wait 20 seconds.
CodSq ell= 3   1071
CodSq ell= 5   2711
CodSq ell= 7   6740
CodSq ell= 11   14924
CodSq ell= 13   18579
CodSq ell= 17   31829
CodSq ell= 19   44376

CodOne ell= 3   771
CodOne ell= 5   2452

...

EvalOne ell= 17   63336
EvalOne ell= 19   83431
```

## 2.The SIDH Attack on B-SIDH.

You can implement the SIDH attack on B-SIDH with two types of parameter: one with 30 security bits and the other with 128.
Remark that, for 128 security bits parameter, it takes about 11 hours.

Write the following command:
```
sage main.sage "attack" {30 or 128}
```

For example, if 30 security bits, 
```
$ sage main.sage "attack" 30
isogeny chain: [13, 23, 37, 43, 47, 47, 59, 61, 71, 73, 97, 101]
ell= 13
ell= 23

...

ell= 97
ell= 101
Attack successful: True
Attack time (sec): 60.96083307266235
```
